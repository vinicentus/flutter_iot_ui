# THIS ID IS UPLOADED TO THE ORACLE CONTRACT
# The complete ID is generated by encoding the child parameters to json
# The length of the resulting json-encoded ID can vary, as long as it doesn't become unreasonably long
# Example: '{"name":"Device1","sensors":["sps30","scd30"],"uniqueId":"0"}'
id:
    name: 'name-12345'
    # LIST CONTAINING ALL TYPES OF SENSORS THAT ARE PRESENT ON THIS DEVICE
    # Possible values are defined ONLY by what the dApp and the oracle device both accept as valid
    # Currently valid values (in this example implementation) are:
    #   - 'sps30'
    #   - 'scd30'
    #   - 'scd41'
    #   - 'svm30'
    sensors:
        - 'sps30-12345'
    # This should probably not be a hash of the other values in this file, in order to not make it reversible. This will after all be publicly available.
